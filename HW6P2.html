<h1>Homework 6P2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Trevor VanAuken</h2>
<h3>This map shows the amount of households per person in each county. I found this by dividing the households by the amount of people.
    The data ranges from .51 to .38, which means that the houses range from having 2 to 3 people on average. I did this measure because
    I though it would be interesting to see if there were any counties with wierd proportions, but there unfortunately were not in Ohio.
</h3>

<h3>Equal Count</h3>
<h5>Equal Count's pros are that the number of each class is the same, which makes it easy to understand. However, it is bad
    at showing any outliers, since they will just be lumped into the rest of the class.

<h3>Equal Interval</h3>
<h5>Equal Interval's pros are that the interval in each class is the same, which makes it easy to understand the legend. A con is that
    they can not show classes if there is no data in that range.

<h3>Natural Breaks</h3>
<h5>Natural Breaks' pros are that they try to find the most natural areas for the classes to be made, which is structured around small areas 
    of high concentration. Natural Breaks can come in wierd sizes, however, so it can be hard to understand if you don't pay close attention.</h5>
